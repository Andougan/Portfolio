This is a set of projects that I worked on during my degree. Feel free to download anything you want!
The zip files include all the files necessary files to run the Java and Python projects (provided you have the proper IDE).
The pdf files include screen shots and text of SQL code as well as information on the database creation process.

•	Mushroom Edibility Classifier: A Jupyter Notebook written in Python that models Mushroom Classification data by using Logistic Regression to give a prediction on an inputted mushroom’s edibility. 
Used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn to provide visualizations of the data and perform data cleaning.

•	Appointment Management System: Java application that connects to a MySQL database containing information on customers, appointments, and users. 
The system includes Login, Customer registration, and Appointment scheduling capabilities in two languages (English or French depending on your system’s default language). 
The system uses FXML for the GUI. 

•	Inventory Management System: Java application that uses forms to be filled out by the user for adding, modifying, and removing parts and products from inventory lists. 
Specific items can be found within Lists by using search fields.


•	Package Delivery System: Python application that decides how a set of packages should be loaded and 
delivered optimally for a specific situation. Uses the console within IDE for the GUI.

•	Coffee Database Creation and Analyses: Document containing SQL code for the creation of a small relational database. 
Demonstrated SQL skills with INSERT, JOIN, INDEX, and VIEW as well as string functions and aliasing.

•	DVD Rental Data Management and Analyses: Set up stored procedures and functions with triggers for inserting data into one table whenever data is inserted into another table; 
used JOIN, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY within subqueries for writing complex functions; and created a function for casting a TIMESTAMP to a DATE datatype.
